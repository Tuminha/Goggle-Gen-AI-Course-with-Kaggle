        "\n",
        "ReAct (Reason and Act) is a prompting paradigm that enables large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks by combining natural language reasoning with the ability to take actions—such as searching the web or running code. This approach allows the LLM to interact with external tools (like search APIs or code interpreters), making it a foundational step toward building AI agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "ReAct mimics how humans operate: we reason about a problem, take actions to gather more information, and then update our reasoning based on what we learn. In practice, ReAct prompting creates a \"thought-action loop\" where the LLM:\n",
        "1. Reasons about the problem and generates a plan.\n",
        "2. Executes actions (e.g., web searches) based on that plan.\n",
        "3. Observes the results of those actions.\n",
        "4. Updates its reasoning and plans the next steps.\n",
        "5. Repeats this process until it reaches a solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code, we’ll use the LangChain framework for Python, together with VertexAI and the SerpAPI search tool. To run this, you’ll need a (free) SerpAPI key from [serpapi.com](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key) and set it as the `SERPAPI_API_KEY` environment variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The example task: \"How many children have a famous dad that performs in the band Metallica?\" The LLM will reason through the problem, use web search to find the number of children for each band member, and sum the results—demonstrating the ReAct approach in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "After running the code, you’ll see how the agent chains together multiple searches, tracks its observations, and arrives at the final answer. This showcases how ReAct prompting enables LLMs to break down and solve multi-step, real-world problems by reasoning and acting iteratively.\n",
